      "\n",
      " # 1 . Country and sector issues \n",
      "\n",
      " 1 . Mexico has a good electricity system . However , the country relies heavily on fossil fuels for power generation . With an installed capacity of about $ 5 3 \\mathrm { G W } $ , an annual production of about 220,000 Gigawatthour (GWh) , and an estimated population coverage of about 95 percent1 , electricity services in Mexico are among the best in Latin America . Average per capita consumption of electricity is in line with the level of economic development of the country ( middle-income ) and has been growing steadily . In the last decade , electricity demand grew on average 5.2 percent per year while at the same time economic growth was averaging about 3.5 percent annually . The rate of growth of demand for electricity is expected to remain at similar levels in the next few years , but it could increase if the pace of economic growth accelerates2 . Significant investments in new generation capacity will be needed in the next decade to ensure that there will be adequate supply of electricity to meet the growing demand . Growing electricity demand coupled with significant thermal generation and recent trends towards high fuel prices create a need for diversification of energy supply options . \n",
      "\n",
      " 2 . The Mexican electricity sector is dominated by two state-owned companies : the Federal Electricity Commission ( National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) ) , which serves most of the Mexican territory ; and Luz y Fuerza del Centro ( Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC) ) , which is responsible for providing electricity services in the area of Mexico City and its surroundings . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is a vertically integrated electricity company that controls the majority of generation , the transmission system and energy dispatching functions , while it is also responsible for the distribution and commercialization of electricity . Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC) is primarily devoted to distribution and commercialization and owns a small part of generation . In 1992 , the Electricity Public Service Law was introduced , reducing CFE‟s legal monopoly in power generation . The objectives of the reform were to foster private participation in electricity generation , to entitle open access to the transmission grid for all participants in the sector , and to optimize short and long-term costs . \n",
      "\n",
      " 3 . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) remains today the owner of the majority of generating capacity . However , Independent Power Producers ( Independent Power Producers (IPPs) ) are currently operating about 8.2 Gigawatt (GW) of generation -- mostly combined cycle plants using natural gas . The electricity market is now a monopsony . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is the main buyer carrying out bidding processes to develop major electricity generation projects . These processes include Build , Lease and Transfer ( Build-Lease-Transfer (BLT) ) projects , and ( Independent Power Producers (IPP) ) schemes . The Independent Power Producers (IPP) scheme is becoming increasingly important in bringing new capacity , but specific conditions for the buying of electricity and responsibilities for the provision of fuel are set on a project by project basis . Based on the corresponding law issued in 1995 , the Energy Regulatory Commission ( CRE ) issues generation permits for : ( i ) self-supply ; ( ii ) cogeneration ; ( iii ) smallscale production ; ( iv ) independent power production , and ( v ) permits for imports and exports . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) retains control of the long-term planning of the electricity system and , in coordination with the Ministry of Energy ( Secretaría de Energía , SENER ) issues multi-year plans of expansion that direct the majority of private , or public , investments in generating capacity . \n",
      "\n",
      " 4 . About 80 percent of the energy generated in Mexico is from thermal plants , although the installed thermal capacity is about 67 percent of the total . The remaining generation is hydro , nuclear and a small percentage of other renewables including geothermal . Oil and gas are the main fuels for the country‟s thermal plants , with coal representing a smaller percentage of the fossil fuel generation . Because a portion of the natural gas used for generation is imported from the north , generation costs have been exposed in the recent years to the spikes in natural gas prices experienced in the USA market , and the recent increases in oil prices have resulted in increased economic costs for electricity generation across the system . \n",
      "\n",
      " 5 . The government of Mexico ( Government of Mexico (GoM) ) publishes annually through SENER a ten-year plan for the expansion of the electricity system and has recognized the need to gradually increase the diversity of the fuel mix for electricity generation . Mexico has very good potential to develop alternative sources of energy and , especially in the South , the potential for wind energy is considerable . Nevertheless , today only a few Megawatt (MW) of wind power are operating in the country . The country has ratified the Kyoto Protocol , while a special law to support the promotion of renewable energy is expected in the coming months . \n",
      "\n",
      " # 2 . Rationale for Bank involvement \n",
      "\n",
      " 6 . The World Bank has been supporting for a number of years the Government of Mexico (GoM) in its effort to further diversify the fuel mix for electricity generation , to improve the environmental performance in the electricity sector , and to promote renewable energy . A number of technical assistance activities3 and an upcoming Global Environment Facility ( Global Environment Facility (GEF) ) project focusing on the promotion of large-scale electricity generation using renewable sources are examples of the World Bank‟s recent involvement in the sector . \n",
      "\n",
      " 7 . This project fits within the general framework of supporting renewable energy promotion in the country , and it would be the first wind energy project in Mexico under the Clean Development Mechanism ( Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) ) . The Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ) has recently entered into force ( February 2005 ) . This international agreement commits industrialized countries to reduce their carbon emissions by an average of 5.2 below their 1990 levels during the period 2008 - 2012 . The Protocol provides for two flexibility mechanisms for meeting these obligations - the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation ( Joint Implementation (JI) ) . The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) enables industrialized countries to meet some of their obligations through the purchasing of emissions reduction from projects that generate such emission reductions in developing countries ( which do not have an obligation to reduce their emissions under the Kyoto Protocol ) . \n",
      "\n",
      " 8 . The World Bank‟s involvement in the project would assist in demonstrating the potential of wind energy projects to realize significant additional income related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions using Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) . Income from carbon financing would assist the financial viability of wind energy projects and , as the projects are implemented , it would facilitate the transfer of environmentally and economically beneficial technology to Mexico . The World Bank has pioneered such transactions in Latin America ( Colombia ) , and around the world ( Philippines ) . The Bank has also supported a number of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in Mexico for municipal solid waste management and their associated electricity generation projects , as well as a rapid transit system for public transportation in Mexico City . In the proposed project to purchase emissions reductions from the La Venta II wind energy project , the World Bank would assist National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) to develop its capacity to identify , develop and implement projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) framework . \n",
      "\n",
      " 9 . The World Bank 's involvement in carbon finance helps to ensure consistency between the individual projects it supports and the international dialogue on climate change , while providing the opportunity to mobilize global experts with experience in the field , technical support for project preparation , supervision capacity , and development of linkages with other sources of expertise and funding . By mobilizing the private and public sectors on an important new source of project finance , the Carbon Finance Unit of the World Bank ( ENVCF ) is developing an important knowledge base and is demonstrating how insights and experience from both sectors can be pooled to mobilize additional resources for sustainable development and address global environmental concerns . \n",
      "\n",
      " 10 . The World Bank‟s involvement in this project , as a trustee of the Bio Carbon Fund and the Spanish Carbon Fund , allows purchase of emissions reductions beyond 2012 using the principles of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) mechanism . This arrangement reduces the uncertainty regarding the value of emissions reductions beyond the period mandated by the Kyoto Protocol and enhances the financial viability of the project . \n",
      "\n",
      " # 3 . Higher level objectives to which the project contributes \n",
      "\n",
      " 11 . The project would contribute to the higher level objectives of poverty reduction and increased economic growth , by promoting the diversification of energy sources in power generation to control high electricity costs from fossil fuels . Furthermore , the project will contribute to the objective of promoting environmental sustainability in Mexico by demonstrating the potential of carbon financing to catalyze and advance economically beneficial investments in wind energy in Mexico . \n",
      "\n",
      " 12 . The proposed Project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy ( Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) ) which proposes to support the Government of Mexico (GoM) in four pillars : ( i ) reduce poverty and inequality ; ( ii ) increase competitiveness ; ( iii ) strengthen institutions ; and , ( iv ) promote environmental sustainability . The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) specifically mentions , under pillar ( iv ) , that the Bank will support the Government of Mexico (GoM) in its efforts to address the issue of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions . \n",
      "\n",
      " 13 . The project is also linked to pillars ( i ) and ( ii ) because expensive electricity can hurt economic growth as it affects production costs , investments in productive activities , and therefore the overall competitiveness of the country . Because Mexico‟s electricity system is predominantly fossil-fuel based , when prices of combustibles are high the economic costs of power generation increase significantly . The recent high oil and gas prices combined with risks regarding their future values , present an important challenge for the electricity sector of the country . The proposed Project aims to introduce an alternative , indigenous , renewable , and competitive source of supply for electricity . The large-scale use of wind energy for power generation could contribute in alleviating the high costs of electricity and therefore influence positively the country‟s economic growth and competitiveness . \n",
      "\n",
      " 14 . Using wind energy for electricity generation is one of the most environmentally friendly technological options available today . Wind energy projects in Mexico would result in clear environmental benefits for the country . Moreover , wind energy projects would provide additional income to land-owners in rural areas because electricity plant operators pay a fee for placing the wind turbines . Further local benefits in areas where such plants are located include increased and diverse employment opportunities . \n",
      "\n",
      " # B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION \n",
      "\n",
      " # 1 . Purchase of Carbon Emissions Reductions \n",
      "\n",
      " 15 . The proposed project will purchase a specific amount , to be agreed in the Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) , of Verified Emissions Reductions ( Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs) ) from the approximately 190,000 tCO2e of emissions reductions that La Venta II wind power plant is expected to generate annually . The project would reduce greenhouse gases emissions because it generates electricity using wind energy with no associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and would replace electricity , which would otherwise be generated using fossil fuel alternatives . \n",
      "\n",
      " # 2 . Project development objective and key indicators \n",
      "\n",
      " 16 . The project aims to reduce greenhouse gases emissions from power generation in Mexico and promote investment in wind energy in Mexico to diversify the sources of power generation in the country . \n",
      "\n",
      " 17 . The project will contribute to the further development of the international carbon market in Mexico through the supply of Emissions Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism ( Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) ) as set forth under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol . The project is expected to reduce about 4 million tCO2e over a 20-year operation period . Key performance indicator is the creation of Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs) through the electricity generation of the power plant . Secondary indicators of success concern future operations of the same type that will appear in the country ( demonstration effect ) . \n",
      "\n",
      " 18 . This project supports the first large-scale investment in wind energy in the country and will create experience and knowledge in the development operation and maintenance of wind energy generation facilities . \n",

      "\n",
      " 19 . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) uses a long-term power planning simulation model ( DECADES ) to select future power plants that are needed for the expansion of the country‟s electricity system . On the basis of such modeling results it is possible to compare alternative scenarios of new generation plants and estimate emissions with- and without- the wind power plants in the long term . During the operational period the actual dispatching of energy generated from the wind power plant is controlled by the National Center for Energy Control ( National Center of Energy Control (Centro Nacional de Control de Energía) (CENACE) ) and can be monitored in real time to record the amount of electricity produced from the plant and the equivalent avoided emissions for verification purposes . \n",
      "\n",
      " 20 . According to the feasibility study , the La Venta II project consists of a wind energy power plant with a nominal capacity of $ 8 3 . 3 \\mathrm { M W } $ and its associated interconnection system . The plant would provide annually about 308 Gigawatthour (GWh) on average , resulting in an annual reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) of about 190,000 tons of $ \\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } $ ( tCO2e ) . The plant will be owned and operated by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) and will be the first large-scale wind energy plant in Mexico , located in the Ejido La Venta , in the municipality of Juchitán de Zaragoza , in the state of Oaxaca . \n",
      "\n",
      " 21 . The project would reduce about 4 million tCO2e over its 20 year lifetime period . The World Bank would purchase on behalf of the Spanish Carbon Fund Verified Emissions Reductions ( VER ) from the project for the period 2007 - 2016 ( total cost $ \\mathrm { U S } \\$ 16,258,211 ) $ and on behalf of the Bio-Carbon Fund for the period 2017 - 2019 ( total cost US\\$1,215,000 ) . \n",

The purchase of Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs) under this project means that the emission reductions will be verified annually by an accredited organization and their statement will be transmitted to the carbon funds . An advance payment to the sponsor will occur upon reception of the power plant from the contractor responsible for construction and the remainder will be paid annually in the period 2007 - 2012 after subtracting the advance payment . \n",

      " 23 . Emissions reductions will be the result of CFE‟s wind energy project to be located in the ejido la Venta , municipality of Juchitán de Zaragoza , a region known as the Istmo de Tehuantepec , state of Oaxaca . CFE‟s wind energy project will use wind turbine generators that transform the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electricity . The project will install 98 wind turbines ( Gamesa , $ \\mathrm { G } { - } 5 2 ~ 8 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { k W } ) $ in four parallel lines oriented East to West , vertically to the prevalent wind direction . The engineering study provides for adequate distance between individual turbines and the turbine lines , while there is also a provision to reserve an area towards the North to ensure unobstructed wind currents to the plant . The actual use ( agricultural , livestock ) of the fields where the turbines will be located will not change as the footprint of the actual wind turbines and associated infrastructure ( access roads , interconnection lines , etc ) is only about 20 ha when the total project area is estimated to be about 1,300 ha . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has entered into an agreement with the local community ( Ejido La Venta ) and individual landowners to pay a fee ( rent ) for the power plant . The project will be connected to the national grid via an interconnection line of $ 2 3 0 \\mathrm { k V } $ with a length of about $ 1 8 \\mathrm { k m } $ along existing roads . \n",
      "\n",
      " 24 . The proposed project was selected by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) on the basis of the exceptional wind energy resource available in the region of La Venta in Oaxaca and the short-term and medium-term expansion plans of National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) prepares its plans using simulation models ( WASP and others ) of the electricity system and relevant demand projections to prepare optimal expansion plans . The proposed project is a result of such a system optimization exercise . It should be noted that according to CFE‟s planning another $ 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { M W } $ of wind energy plants could be installed in the same region in the next five years . The underlying assumption is that the demand growth in the Eastern part of the electricity system will be on average about 5.2 percent for the period 2004- 2013 . \n",

      " # 4 . Lessons learned and reflected in the project design \n",
      "\n",
      " 25 . The World Bank has been involved , initially through the Global Environment Facility (GEF) , and more recently using carbon finance , in a number of projects that promote renewable energy and reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and has supported a number of wind energy projects around the world ( e.g. China , Colombia , Costa Rica , Philippines , and others ) . These projects have demonstrated the potential of carbon finance to provide additional income to power plant owners and to improve the environmental performance of electricity systems . \n",
      "\n",
      " 26 . Lessons from such operations indicate that the availability of carbon financing is important for the financial viability of wind energy power plants , and that when operational and technical risks are well-managed , such projects can have an important demonstration effect to further promote clean energy technologies as an environmentally friendly alternative to power generation . \n",
      "\n",
      " 27 . The project sponsor , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) --a company with very good technical capacity-- has been operating a small pilot wind power plant in the same region for about a decade and has collected significant experience and data to ensure the management of the project‟s technical and operational risks . \n",
      "\n",
      " 28 . Furthermore , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has developed links with the local community and has employed social and environmental specialists to work with the local community and individual landowners to agree on a fair compensation for the use of land for wind turbines , and to educate people on the benefits of wind energy in the region . The La Venta II project has benefited from a USAID-funded study on international practices regarding issues of compensation to land owners , and related activities to increase the understanding among local community members on the minimal impacts to land and the environment of wind energy . \n",

      " # 5 . Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection \n",
      "\n",
      " 29 . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has considered alternative electricity system expansion options under its standard planning practice and the preferred solution for new electricity generation tends to be combined cycle generation turbines fueled by natural gas . However , given the volatility of natural gas prices , uncertainties regarding long-term supplies , and considering also the environmental benefits of wind energy , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) concluded that wind energy could be a viable option for additional power generation . Because of prevailing high winds , and proximity to the national grid , the region of La Venta in Oaxaca was selected as an optimal location for a larger scale wind plant . \n",
      "\n",
      " 30 . A number of alternative engineering designs and nearby sites were also considered during the pre-feasibility stage , but given the experience of National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) in the particular area since 1994 with a smaller pilot project ( capacity of 1.5 Megawatt (MW) ) and its relationship with the local community the proposed site was selected . \n",

CFE‟s investment in the power plant is authorized by a budgetary allocation from the central government under the scheme of Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry ( Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto , Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry (Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto) (PIDIREGAS) ) , using the Financed Public Project ( Obra Pública Financiada , Publicly Finance Works (Obra Pública Financiada) (OPF) ) modality . Under the Publicly Finance Works (Obra Pública Financiada) (OPF) scheme , the contractor is responsible for the construction phase , including its financing . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) pays fully the contractor upon satisfactory reception of the project , at which point National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) becomes the project‟s owner . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) finances the project , under financing modalities authorized by the Ministry of Economy and Public Credit ( Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público , SHCP ) , accessing the financial markets , or borrowing from national , or international , financial institutions . \n",

To increase the likelihood that emissions reductions will be recognized by the parties to the Kyoto Protocol , independent experts provide baseline validation and verification/certification procedures for emissions reductions . The emissions reductions estimates are based on the findings of a baseline study , validated by independent experts . The actual dispatching of the electricity generated by the wind energy plant will be monitored by the regional office of National Center of Energy Control (Centro Nacional de Control de Energía) (CENACE) in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Monitoring Plan (MP) . The Baseline Study and the Monitoring Plan will be finalized during appraisal . \n",

      "\n",
      " 44 . The economic and financial analyses were done in April 2006 , before Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) negotiations took place , so they reflect the existing market conditions ( i.e. Certified Emissions Reduction (CER) prices ) at that previous time . The two ERPAs ( with the Spanish Carbon Fund and with the BioCarbon Fund ) were signed on December 2006 , and the terms agreed with National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) , which remain confidential , reflected market conditions at that later date . \n",
      "\n",
      " # Economic Analysis \n",
      "\n",
      " 45 . The main economic benefits of the La Venta II wind energy project are : ( i ) the production of electricity ; and ( ii ) the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the global atmosphere . Other economic benefits , not quantified for the purposes of this analysis but useful in evaluating the project in a qualitative manner as well , are : ( i ) local economic benefits of increased employment during construction , operation and maintenance of the wind power plant ; ( ii ) increased income from land where the turbines are located --without altering the use of the land ; ( iii ) better access to agricultural land due to improved local infrastructure ( roads , etc ) ; ( iv ) accumulation of experience in the operation of large-scale wind power in Mexico and accompanying demonstration effects ; ( v ) avoided local pollution from fossil-fuel alternatives ( NOx , SOx , etc ) ; and , ( vi ) increased diversification in the fuel mix for electricity generation in the country . \n",
      "\n",
      " 46 . The main economic costs of the wind energy project are : ( i ) the investment necessary for the construction of the project ; and , ( ii ) the costs of operation and maintenance . \n",
      "\n",
      " 47 . The cost-benefit analysis for the La Venta II project ( see Annex 9 ) shows that the project has a positive Net Present Value ( Net Present Value (NPV) ) for a discount rate of 11 percent if the economic benefits of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions are taken into account5 . The analysis also shows that without the emissions reductions the project would return a positive economic Net Present Value (NPV) only at a 9 percent discount rate . The following table summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis with and without the contribution of benefits from carbon emissions reductions for a range of discount rates . \n",

      " 48 . Finally , the economic rate of return of the La Venta II project is highly sensitive to the estimates regarding the future costs of electricity generation in the system as presented in table D.2 below . The costs for electricity generation in the Mexican system are influenced significantly by the cost of natural gas and oil . It is estimated that at a reference price of $ \\mathrm { U S } \\$ 46 $ per barrel of crude oil the average system generation cost is about $ \\mathrm { U S } \\$ 0.045 $ per kWh . \n",

      "\n",
      " 49 . The financial position of National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) ( the La Venta II project sponsor ) is closely related with the policies of the Government of Mexico (GoM) applied through SHCP . With assets of about $ \\mathrm { U S } \\$ 5 $ 9Billion and an equity value of about US\\$33Billion , combined with its close relationship with the Federal Government of Mexico , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) can be viewed as a solid company for the purposes of this project . Indeed , the company has good access to financial markets and has issued successfully bonds on its behalf in overseas markets in recent years . \n",
      "\n",
      " 50 . The La Venta II wind energy project has been approved and assigned a budget allocation by the Government of Mexico (GoM) under the general scheme of Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry ( Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto , Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry (Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto) (PIDIREGAS) ) , using the Financed Public Project ( Obra Pública Financiada , Publicly Finance Works (Obra Pública Financiada) (OPF) ) modality . The winning bidder for the power plant „ turn-key‟ contract assumes the financing and construction risk of the project . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) pays the contractor when the project is completed and received by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) ; CFE‟s payment to the contractor is fully backed by government guarantees . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) then obtains long-term financing for the amount of the Publicly Finance Works (Obra Pública Financiada) (OPF) contract through the commercial financial markets , with the approval of SHCP . \n",
      "\n",
      " 51 . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is expected to fully finance the La Venta II project using debt . Under this special financial structure , and using the assumptions presented in Annex 9 , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has a positive financial cash flow from the operation of the plant year after year . At a discount rate of 12 percent the present value of the project to National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is about $ \\mathrm { U S S } 1 3 \\mathrm { m } $ if the revenues from emissions reductions are considered and about $ \\mathrm { U S S 7 . 2 m } $ without considering emissions reductions revenues . \n",
      "\n",
      " 52 . A sensitivity analysis of the assumptions shows that as long as National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has access to the expected adequate financing terms , allowing the company to service the debt and its taxes with project revenues , it is very likely to make a profit from the project . The analysis also shows that income from the selling of emissions reductions is important to ensure the financial viability of the project . \n",

      " # Fiscal Impact \n",
      "\n",
      " 53 . Since the World Bank is not a lender in this project , there are no fiscal impacts of Banklending activities . The fiscal impact on the project will be related to the duty fee paid to the Government of Mexico (GoM) by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) on the net asset value of the La Venta II power plant . Such a fee will be determined by SHCP in future years depending on the overall profitability of the company . However , emission reductions‟ sales from National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) to the Spanish Carbon Fund and the Bio-Carbon Fund will contribute positively to the revenue stream of National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) and will influence positively either the equity of the company , or the fiscal position of the country . \n",
      "\n",
      " 54 . There is , however , a broader fiscal impact because the wind energy project is financed through Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry (Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto) (PIDIREGAS) . Financial obligations under Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry (Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto) (PIDIREGAS) are being brought into the budget process as the outlays for interest and amortization of previous years‟ projects are registered in the spending budget . The fiscal impact of the La Venta II project will depend on the final financing terms authorized by SHCP for the project . For instance , a loan for the full project amount with a repayment period of 15 years , constant payments , and a fixed interest rate of 7 percent to 9 percent , would require annual payments of about $ \\mathrm { U S S } 1 2 . 5 $ million to $ \\mathrm { U S S 1 4 . 1 } $ million impacting accordingly the country‟s budget ( the loan is in practice repaid by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) , however from the central government‟s perspective a contingent liability is created –in this case of probably low risk ) . \n",

      " # 2 . Technical \n",
      "\n",
      " 55 . An early feasibility study for a similar wind energy project in the same location was completed with funding from USAID in 2003 ( Feasibility Study of the La Venta II 50 Megawatt (MW) Wind Power Project in Oaxaca , Mexico – document available in project files ) . The feasibility study demonstrated the wind project‟s viability and National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has prepared various engineering studies for the project site including : evaluation of the wind resource , topography , ground mechanics , and an energy flows analysis of the electric system . \n",
      "\n",
      " 56 . The bidding documents for the La Venta II project were prepared by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) in accordance with international standards , and using technical assistance by international experts on matters related to wind plant design and performance characteristics of the wind turbines . Despite the high winds prevailing in the area , the technical design and the guarantees required by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) for the project suggest low technical performance risks . \n",
      "\n",
      " 57 . Additionality . The Kyoto Protocol requires for projects to qualify under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) need to be “ additional ” . “ Additionality ” is assessed against a baseline , which describes what would happen in a “ business as usual ” scenario ( i.e. without the proposed project ) . A project is therefore additional if it reduces the quantity of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that would otherwise be released under a baseline scenario . \n",

The baseline scenario is “ electricity that would have been otherwise generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generating sources ” . Following the selected methodology : ACM0002 , the default baseline emission factor is calculated as a combined margin that consists of : ( i ) a weighted average of the operating margin emission factor ; and ( ii ) the build margin emission factor -all margins expressed in tCO2/MWh . For wind-farm power plants the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board has ruled that an operating margin to build margin ratio of 3 to 1 would be acceptable . The project boundary for the project is the Mexican National Grid . Since no leakages or emissions were identified for the project , emissions reductions will be equal to the baseline emissions . The baseline emission for Mexico applying the above methodology is 0.62570 tCO2e/MWh . The annual project Emissions Reductions (ERs) are then estimated to be about 190,000 tCO2e ( see detailed analysis in Annex 4 ) . \n",

However , for a number of years there has been confusion about the effects and potential economic benefits of wind energy projects in the area . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has conducted an extensive consultation process and negotiated compensations for the use of land in line with international practices . Thus , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has set a benchmark for agreements between project sponsors and land-owners that guarantee a minimum additional income to beneficiaries without compromising traditional uses for the land in the area . \n",

      "\n",
      " Mexico has an advanced electricity system with an installed capacity of about 53 Gigawatt (GW) , an annual production of about 220,000 Gigawatthour (GWh) , annual consumption of about 180,000 Gigawatthour (GWh) , and an estimated population coverage of about 95 percent . Mexico‟s electricity system is one of the best in Latin America.8 \n",
      "\n",
      " Average per capita consumption of electricity is in line with the level of economic development of the country ( middle-income ) and has been growing steadily . Per capita consumption in Mexico was $ 1 { , } 7 8 5 \\ \\mathrm { k W h } $ in 2003 –about a fifth of annual consumption in Japan , and slightly smaller than that of Chile , or Venezuela . In the last decade , electricity demand in Mexico grew on average 5.2 percent per year while at the same time economic growth was averaging about 3.5 percent annually . The rate of growth of demand for electricity is expected to remain at similar levels in the next few years , but it could increase if the pace of economic growth accelerates . The government forecasted for the period 2004 - 2013 an average rate of growth of 5.6 percent based on economic and demographic growth estimates9 . Significant investments in new generation capacity will be needed in the next decade to ensure that there will be adequate supply of electricity to meet the growing demand . \n",
      "\n",
      " The sector is dominated by two state-owned electricity companies : the Federal Electricity Commission ( National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) ) , which serves most of the Mexican territory ; and Luz y Fuerza del Centro ( Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC) ) , which is responsible for providing electricity services in the area of Mexico City and its surroundings . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is a vertically integrated electricity company that controls the majority of generation , the transmission system and energy dispatching functions , while it is also responsible for the distribution and commercialization of electricity . Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC) is primarily devoted to distribution and commercialization and owns a small part of generation ; almost 95 percent of the electricity distributed by Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC) is bought from National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) . In 1992 , the Electricity Public Service Law was reformed , and reduced CFE‟s legal monopoly in power generation . The objectives of the reform were to foster private participation in electricity generation , to entitle open access to the transmission grid for all participants in the sector , and to optimize short and long-term costs . \n",
      "\n",
      " Electricity tariffs for the sale of electricity in Mexico are defined and authorized by the Federal Government through SCHP and , for certain categories of users , tariffs are set below cost . These tariff subsidies are balanced with taxes that National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) should pay to the government . According to National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) the average tariff charged to residential customers in 2003 covered 42 percent of the costs , and for agricultural uses only 28 percent . Residential tariffs are well below the OECD country average , while industrial tariffs are generally higher than in OECD countries . Compared to other Latin American countries , commercial tariffs are among the highest , while industrial and residential tariffs are close to the average . High industrial tariffs have led to an increasing trend towards self-supply by industries during peak-times10 . \n",
      "\n",
      " National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) remains today the owner of the majority of generating capacity . However , Independent Power Producers ( Independent Power Producers (IPPs) ) are currently operating about 8.2 Gigawatt (GW) of generation --mostly combined cycle plants using natural gas . The electricity market is now a monopsony . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is the main buyer carrying out bidding processes to develop major new electricity generation projects . These processes include Build , Lease and Transfer ( Build-Lease-Transfer (BLT) ) projects , and ( Independent Power Producers (IPP) ) schemes . The Independent Power Producers (IPP) scheme is becoming increasingly important in bringing new capacity , but specific conditions for the buying of electricity and responsibilities for the provision of fuel are set on a project by project basis . Based on the corresponding law issued in 1995 , the Energy Regulatory Commission ( CRE ) issues generation permits for : ( i ) self-supply ; ( ii ) cogeneration ; ( iii ) small-scale production ; ( iv ) independent power production , and ( v ) permits for imports and exports . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) retains control of the long-term planning of the electricity system and , in coordination with the Ministry of Energy ( Secretaría de Energía , SENER ) issues multi-year plans of expansion that direct the majority of private , or public , investments in generating capacity . \n",
      "\n",
      " About 80 percent of the energy generated in Mexico is from thermal plants , although the installed thermal capacity is about 67 percent of the total . The remaining generation is hydro , nuclear , and a small percentage of other renewables including geothermal . Oil and gas are the main fuels for the country‟s thermal plants with coal representing a smaller percentage of the fossil fuel generation ( see graph below ) . Because a portion of the natural gas used for generation is imported from the north , generation costs have been exposed in the recent years to the spikes in natural gas prices experienced in the USA market , while the recent increases in oil prices have resulted in increased economic costs for electricity generation across the system . \n",

      " To meet the increasing electricity demand , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) defines the Program of Investments and Works in the Electricity Sector ( Programa de Obras e Inversiones del Sector Eléctrico , POISE ) . The program is based on the sector policy established by SENER related with the costs and use of fuels , as well as CFE‟s projections on costs of operation and maintenance for generation and transmission . These data are incorporated in simulation models ( WASP , PSS/E , MEXICO and others ) of the National Electricity System , which are then used to estimate the minimum cost expansion of the system . \n",
      "\n",
      " In the East area of the electricity system , demand is expected to be on average 5.2 percent for the period 2004 - 2013 . POISE considers that a wind energy plant of $ 8 5 ~ \\mathrm { M W } $ in the project area would contribute in meeting the increasing demand ( the program aims to maintain a reserve margin of 27 percent and an operational margin of 6 percent , in line with accepted international practices ) . \n",
      "\n",
      " The government of Mexico ( Government of Mexico (GoM) ) publishes annually through SENER a ten-year plan for the expansion of the electricity system and has recognized the need to gradually increase the diversity of the fuel mix for electricity generation . Mexico has very good potential to develop alternative sources of energy and , especially in the South , the potential for wind energy is considerable . Nevertheless , today only a few Megawatt (MW) of wind power are operating in the country . The country has ratified the Kyoto Protocol , while a special law to support the promotion of renewable energy is expected in the coming months . \n",

      " According to the feasibility study the project consists of wind energy power plant of a nominal capacity of $ 8 5 ~ \\mathrm { M W } $ $ ( + / - ~ 2 $ percent ) and its associated interconnection system . The plant would provide annually about 308 Gigawatthour (GWh) on average , resulting in an annual reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) of about 190,000 tons of $ \\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 } $ ( tCO2e ) . The plant will be owned and operated by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) and will be the first large-scale wind energy plant in Mexico , located in the Ejido La Venta , in the municipality of Juchitán de Zaragoza , in the state of Oaxaca . \n",

      " # Baseline and Additionality \n",
      "\n",
      " The provisions of the Kyoto Protocol require that “ Reductions in emissions [ … ] be additional to any that would occur in the absence of the certified project activity . ” This is the so called additionality criterion and constitutes the foundation of generating emission reductions ( Emissions Reductions (ERs) ) through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects . \n",
      "\n",
      " “ Additionality ” is assessed against a baseline , which describes what would happen in a “ business as usual ” scenario ( i.e. without the proposed project ) . A project is therefore additional if it reduces the quantity of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that would otherwise be released under a baseline scenario . \n",
      "\n",
      " Emissions Reductions are not likely in the absence of the La Venta II project , because of barriers that wind power plants‟ developers need to overcome in Mexico and the existence of other available alternatives for generation that are more financially attractive i.e. natural gas –fired combined cycle power plants . The National Energy Sector Program 2001 - 2006 , on page 26 , affirms that Mexico has the $ { 9 } ^ { \\mathrm { t h } } $ place in oil reserves and the $ { 9 } ^ { \\mathrm { t h } } $ place in natural gas reserves and that its fiscal income strongly depends on the revenues generated by the oil national industry . Based on data provided by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) , the new installed capacity programmed to be built from 2006 to \n",

      " Finally , the project will be the first large-scale wind power plant to be built in Mexico , there is only one other grid-connected wind power plant named La Venta I of $ 1 . 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { M W } $ ( a pilot plant ) and an off-grid wind power plant ( Guerrero Negro of $ 0 . 6 \\mathrm { M W } $ ) . This project will therefore serve as a technological example to demonstrate the value of the wind potential of Oaxaca .

      " The baseline scenario is “ electricity that would have been otherwise generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generating sources ” . Following the selected methodology : ACM0002 , the default baseline emission factor is calculated as a combined margin ( Combined Margin emission factor (CM) ) , consisting of a weighted average of the operating margin emission factor ( Operating Margin emission factor (OM) ) and the build margin emission factor ( Build Margin emission factor (BM) ) -all margins expressed in tCO2/MWh . The default weights for the Operating Margin emission factor (OM) and Build Margin emission factor (BM) are 0.5 , but for wind-farm power plants the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board has ruled that 0.75/0.25 would be acceptable due its technological characteristics . The project boundary for the project is the Interconnected Mexican National Grid ( Interconnected Mexican National Grid (IMNG) ) . Since no leakages or emissions were identified for the project , emissions reductions will be equal to the baseline emissions , which is to be calculated ex-post annually as outlined below . \n",
      "\n",
      " The Operating Margin is calculated ex-post annually as the weighted average emission of all non-renewable sources in the Mexican Grid . The Build Margin emission factor (BM) is defined as the generation-weighted average emission factor $ \\mathbf { \\Gamma } ( \\mathrm { { t C O } _ { 2 } / M W h } ) $ of the latest 20 percent added capacity . \n",

      " The Interconnected Mexican National Grid (IMNG) generation in 2005 of non-renewable sources was 160,168 Gigawatthour (GWh) , with total emissions of 112,176,682 tCO2 , thus the operating margin ( Operating Margin emission factor (OM) ) gives 0.70033 tCO2e/MWh . As latest capacity addition was composed mainly by combined cycle natural gas fired plants according to National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) ( latest capacity addition data has not been yet made available by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) ) , this technology is deemed to be representative for a build margin ( Build Margin emission factor (BM) ) conservative estimate , thus the Build Margin emission factor (BM) would be 0.40185 tCO2/MWh , which is the tCO2/MWh of a typical gas-fired combined cycle plant in the Interconnected Mexican National Grid (IMNG) . The resulting Combined Margin emission factor (CM) , calculated as the weighted average of the Operating Margin emission factor (OM) and Build Margin emission factor (BM) would be 0.62570 tCO2e/MWh . \n",

      " At most sites , a slight variation in wind speed results in a large variation in energy output , due to the cubic relationship between wind speed and wind energy . At extremely high wind sites , like those in the La Venta region , this effect is reduced because the wind turbines operate at their rated output much of the time . Even if turbines experience slightly lower winds , they still operate at their rated output , minimizing the impact on the annual energy output . As a result , the variation of the wind across years may not be as important as in other sites . \n",

Various configurations for wind turbine placement were studied ( one Row , two Rows with 10 diameter spacing , four rows with 10 diameters spacing , etc ) to project annual outputs from the plant . Finally , to accommodate issues of land availability and the need to coordinate with a large number of landowners , a configuration of four rows with 10 diameters spacing was selected . Under the selected configuration , the net capacity factor of the plant is estimated in the range of 45 percent49 percent which would produce on average 350 Gigawatthour (GWh) annually . \n",

The tariff rates applicable to electric power sales in Mexico are defined and authorized by the Federal Government , through the Department of Revenues of the Treasury Department of SHCP . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is required by law to pay a duty fee to the Government of Mexico (GoM) for the assets it uses to provide electricity services . Duties are determined annually based on the profitability rate established for state owned entities in each year ; for 2004 and 2003 the rate was 9 percent --authorized by SHCP . This rate is applied to the value of the net operating assets of the immediately preceding year and the resulting amount is charged to results of the year . This annual duty expense is compared with non-cash transfers from SHCP to supplement deficient electricity tariff rates ( subsidies from the Government of Mexico (GoM) to certain groups of electricity users ) .

The winning bidder for the power plant „ turn-key‟ contract assumes the financing and construction risk of the project . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) pays the contractor when the project is completed satisfactorily and received by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) ; CFE‟s payment to the contractor is fully backed by government guarantees . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) then obtains long-term financing for the amount of the Publicly Finance Works (Obra Pública Financiada) (OPF) contract through the commercial financial markets , with the approval of SHCP . The details of the commercial financing option to be employed for La Venta II have not yet been decided , but the company is exploring various options with financial institutions . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has received by May 2005 financing offers which , depending on the loan duration period and repayment terms , would result in annual interest rates of about 7 to about 9 percent . \n",

      " Since the World Bank is not a lender in this project , there are no fiscal impacts of Bank-lending activities . The fiscal impact on the project will be related to the fee paid to the Government of Mexico (GoM) on the power plant as an asset . Such a fee will be determined by SHCP in the future years depending on the overall profitability of the company . However , emission reductions‟ sales from National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) to the Spanish Carbon Fund and the Bio-Carbon Fund will contribute positively to the revenue stream of National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) and will influence positively either the equity of the company , or the fiscal position of the country . \n",

      " There is , however , a broader fiscal impact because the wind energy project is financed through Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry (Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto) (PIDIREGAS) . The financial obligations under Projects with Deferred Impact in the Budgetary Registry (Proyectos de Impacto Diferido en el Registro de Gasto) (PIDIREGAS) are being brought into the budget process as the outlays for interest and amortization of previous years‟ projects are registered in the spending budget . The fiscal impact of the La Venta II project will depend on the final financing terms authorized by SHCP for the project . For instance , a loan for the full project amount with a repayment period of 15 years , constant payments , and a fixed interest rate of 7 percent to 9 percent , would require annual payments of about $ \\mathrm { U S S } 1 2 . 5 $ million to $ \\mathrm { U S S 1 4 . 1 } $ million impacting accordingly the country‟s budget ( the loan is in practice repaid by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) , however from the central government‟s perspective a contingent liability is created –in this case of probably low risk ) . \n",

Meeting the growing electricity demand of Mexico requires investments in generating capacity and the various options to meet the growing demand are examined by CFE‟s planning division using sophisticated simulation models . The economic benefits of electricity generation are set , for the purposes of this analysis , at the level of the avoided cost of generating electricity using other options . CFE‟s project presentation to SHCP implies that the opportunity cost of such electricity would be in the range of 0.036 to 0.04 cents/kWh . Nevertheless , this is an estimate subject to important fuel costs assumptions that can not be predicted with accuracy over the long-term . \n",
      "\n",
      " Given the significant exposure of the Mexican electricity generation to fossil fuels and uncertainties surrounding the future costs for combustibles , the optimal ( least-cost ) system expansion solution could vary . The estimated future costs for electricity generation in Mexico are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the economic costs of oil and natural gas and , to a lesser extent , of coal . CFE‟s planners use reference values provided by SENER , which in turn elaborates such estimates with the assistance of the national petroleum company ( Petróleos Mexicanos , Mexican Petroleum (Petróleos Mexicanos) (PEMEX) ) . Future generation plants in Mexico , according to CFE‟s plans , should mostly be natural gas cycle turbines ( combined- , or open- ) , a technological option that has been used extensively in the previous decade to serve the growing demand . The estimates used for average prices for natural gas in 2005,2006 , 2007 and 2008 were assumed to be in the range of 4 to $ 5 ~ \\mathrm { U S } \\$ \\mathrm { m B t u } $ ( it should be noted that in 2005 the average price for natural gas in the Henry Hub natural gas index exceeded this range by a significant margin ) . The opportunity cost of 0.036 to 0.04 cents/kWh could therefore be an underestimate . \n",

      " In addition , if data from a study15 done in the USA for the hedging value of wind due to gas price volatility is applied , there would be a premium hedge value of about 0.5 - 0.8 US cents/kWh available for wind projects . Given the avoided cost of 4 cents/kWh this premium could be a significant value . The following table in the same study provides a range of the futures premium for gas for long term contracts . For the specific project referenced , the hedging premium is about 0.37 to 0.59 UScents/kWh \n",

      "\n",
      " The key environmental impact concerns the potential collision of birds ( native and migratory ) with the wind turbines during operation . Based on international practices for wind projects , mitigation measures for this issue aim to make visible the wind turbines to the birds , by painting the blades of the turbines appropriately . Other measures to be employed in the project , in accordance with international criteria , are : use of tubular structures for the wind turbines ; monitoring and registering of dead birds , and quick removal of any dead birds to avoid ravens ; and , ensuring that the height of turbines does not exceed $ 1 5 0 \\mathrm { m } $ . National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) has been implementing since 2004 , as presented in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) , a program of monitoring of the birds in the zone of influence of the project . In addition to the above , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is planning to implement a radar system that would detect the passage of big numbers of migratory birds , so that it can temporary suspend the rotation of wind turbines to avoid collisions . This radar has been purchased by the Instituto de Ecología ( CFE‟s contractor for the avian monitoring ) . In addition , National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) is developing a plan to train observers that could advise the plant operator to shut down in advance specific turbines that might present risk to incoming birds . \n",
      "\n",
      " Based on the monitoring plan carried out by National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) since 2004 , it appears that the bird migration in the Project‟s zone of influence is concentrated during a period of only three weeks , usually in October . Observation of spring bird migration carried out in 2006 did not register birds migrating through the zone of influence ( the prevailing winds appear to hinder the passage of birds from the area during that season ) . In addition , the monitoring program noted that migratory birds passing around the project zone do not fly during night time . Based on these observations , a shutdown plan would be at a maximum implemented over a period of three weeks in October , and mostly during daytime . During that time period it is possible that by shutting down only selected wind turbines the avian collision risk will be mitigated . \n",
      "\n",
      " In terms of the economic/financial effects to the project if such a plan is implemented , it should be noted that during the month of October the plant has an output of about 8 percent of its total annual output . If shutdowns were to be implemented during the whole period of three weeks during daytime , the reduction of total output could be around 3 percent . However , it appears that only a small number of the turbines will have to be stopped and most likely only for a few hours during daytime –if the radar system and trained observers are employed . Finally , it is expected that National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) would schedule maintenance activities of the plant around that period , so the overall economic effect while negative it could be considered negligible . \n",

      " The project will benefit directly the ejidatarios that own land in the project‟s zone of influence and indirectly all the ejidatarios of La Venta II according to a plan of social works negotiated between National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) and the local authorities of the ejido . The plan includes : ( i ) the creation of a trust fund ( created in December 2005 and capitalized with 7million Mexican Pesos ) to provide public lighting , paving of the principal streets of the ejido and computers for the secondary school ; and ( ii ) the creation of an employment agency that would give priority to the ejidatarios in the works during the installation of the wind turbines . The plan will be executed by the authorities of the ejido with the support of National Electric Commission (Comisión Nacional de Electricidad) (CFE) , the Ministry of Social Development ( Secretaría de Desarrollo Social , SEDESOL ) and the Ministry of Agriculture , Rural Development , Fishing and Food ( Secretaría de Agricultura , Ganadería , Desarrrollo Rural , Pesca y Alimentación ) . \n",

In July 2004 , most ejidatarios with rights to the ejido La Venta , signed an agreement for the construction of the wind power project La Venta II for a 100MW capacity and a surface of 2088.54 hectares ( copy of the notarized agreement is available in project files ) . The contract will last 30 years and will be reviewed annually for any necessary adjustments . The agreed payments are as follows : \n",

INAH prepared a report about the exploration indicating that archeological remains were found in the Rastro Tolistoque site , which is distant from the project‟s location . INAH extended to the ejido‟s authorities the report of the findings and the location of the archeological site . The Protected Natural Areas Commission ( CONANP ) authorizes the ejido to keep and maintain the area called Ojo de Agua ( 1,306 ha ) located in the Tolistoque hill . \n",
