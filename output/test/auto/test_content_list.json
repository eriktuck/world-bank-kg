With an installed capacity of about $5 3 \\mathrm { G W }$ , an annual production of about 220,000 GWh, and an estimated population coverage of about 95 percent1, electricity services in Mexico are among the best in Latin America. Average per capita consumption of electricity is in line with the level of economic development of the country (middle-income) and has been growing steadily. In the last decade, electricity demand grew on average 5.2 percent per year while at the same time economic growth was averaging about 3.5 percent annually. The rate of growth of demand for electricity is expected to remain at similar levels in the next few years, but it could increase if the pace of economic growth accelerates2. Significant investments in new generation capacity will be needed in the next decade to ensure that there will be adequate supply of electricity to meet the growing demand. Growing electricity demand coupled with significant thermal generation and recent trends towards high fuel prices create a need for diversification of energy supply options. ",

The Mexican electricity sector is dominated by two state-owned companies: the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), which serves most of the Mexican territory; and Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC), which is responsible for providing electricity services in the area of Mexico City and its surroundings. CFE is a vertically integrated electricity company that controls the majority of generation, the transmission system and energy dispatching functions, while it is also responsible for the distribution and commercialization of electricity. LFC is primarily devoted to distribution and commercialization and owns a small part of generation. In 1992, the Electricity Public Service Law was introduced, reducing CFE‟s legal monopoly in power generation. The objectives of the reform were to foster private participation in electricity generation, to entitle open access to the transmission grid for all participants in the sector, and to optimize short and long-term costs.

However, Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are currently operating about 8.2 GW of generation -- mostly combined cycle plants using natural gas. The electricity market is now a monopsony. CFE is the main buyer carrying out bidding processes to develop major electricity generation projects. These processes include Build, Lease and Transfer (BLT) projects, and (IPP) schemes. The IPP scheme is becoming increasingly important in bringing new capacity, but specific conditions for the buying of electricity and responsibilities for the provision of fuel are set on a project by project basis. Based on the corresponding law issued in 1995, the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) issues generation permits for: (i) self-supply; (ii) cogeneration; (iii) smallscale production; (iv) independent power production, and (v) permits for imports and exports. CFE retains control of the long-term planning of the electricity system and, in coordination with the Ministry of Energy (Secretaría de Energía, SENER) issues multi-year plans of expansion that direct the majority of private, or public, investments in generating capacity.

Oil and gas are the main fuels for the country‟s thermal plants, with coal representing a smaller percentage of the fossil fuel generation. Because a portion of the natural gas used for generation is imported from the north, generation costs have been exposed in the recent years to the spikes in natural gas prices experienced in the USA market, and the recent increases in oil prices have resulted in increased economic costs for electricity generation across the system.

This international agreement commits industrialized countries to reduce their carbon emissions by an average of 5.2 below their 1990 levels during the period 2008-2012. The Protocol provides for two flexibility mechanisms for meeting these obligations - the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation (JI). The CDM enables industrialized countries to meet some of their obligations through the purchasing of emissions reduction from projects that generate such emission reductions in developing countries (which do not have an obligation to reduce their emissions under the Kyoto Protocol).

The World Bank has pioneered such transactions in Latin America (Colombia), and around the world (Philippines). The Bank has also supported a number of CDM projects in Mexico for municipal solid waste management and their associated electricity generation projects, as well as a rapid transit system for public transportation in Mexico City.

For wind-farm power plants the CDM Executive Board has ruled that an operating margin to build margin ratio of 3 to 1 would be acceptable. The project boundary for the project is the Mexican National Grid. Since no leakages or emissions were identified for the project, emissions reductions will be equal to the baseline emissions. The baseline emission for Mexico applying the above methodology is 0.62570 tCO2e/MWh. The annual project ERs are then estimated to be about 190,000 tCO2e (see detailed analysis in Annex 4). ",

In the last decade, electricity demand in Mexico grew on average 5.2 percent per year while at the same time economic growth was averaging about 3.5 percent annually. The rate of growth of demand for electricity is expected to remain at similar levels in the next few years, but it could increase if the pace of economic growth accelerates. The government forecasted for the period 2004-2013 an average rate of growth of 5.6 percent based on economic and demographic growth estimates9. Significant investments in new generation capacity will be needed in the next decade to ensure that there will be adequate supply of electricity to meet the growing demand. ",

LFC is primarily devoted to distribution and commercialization and owns a small part of generation; almost 95 percent of the electricity distributed by LFC is bought from CFE. In 1992, the Electricity Public Service Law was reformed, and reduced CFE‟s legal monopoly in power generation. The objectives of the reform were to foster private participation in electricity generation, to entitle open access to the transmission grid for all participants in the sector, and to optimize short and long-term costs.

Various configurations for wind turbine placement were studied (one Row, two Rows with 10 diameter spacing, four rows with 10 diameters spacing, etc) to project annual outputs from the plant. Finally, to accommodate issues of land availability and the need to coordinate with a large number of landowners, a configuration of four rows with 10 diameters spacing was selected. Under the selected configuration, the net capacity factor of the plant is estimated in the range of 45 percent49 percent which would produce on average 350 GWh annually. ",

Duties are determined annually based on the profitability rate established for state owned entities in each year; for 2004 and 2003 the rate was 9 percent --authorized by SHCP. This rate is applied to the value of the net operating assets of the immediately preceding year and the resulting amount is charged to results of the year. This annual duty expense is compared with non-cash transfers from SHCP to supplement deficient electricity tariff rates (subsidies from the GoM to certain groups of electricity users). Up to 1999 a net liability had been generated in favor of the Federal Government, which was not payable, but was capitalized as equity in CFE at the close of each year. However, since the fiscal year 2000 the amount of the duties has been below that of the subsidy, with the insufficiency directly reducing the CFE‟s equity value14.

In this ejido, zapoteco peasants have been traditionally dedicated to agriculture, mainly to sugar cane crop and other products for family consumption such as corn, beans and pumpkin. With the fall of sugar prices, sugar cane cultivation is no longer the main economic activity; it has been replaced by cattle raising, and cultivation of sorghum crop, watermelons, peanuts, melons, cucumbers and sesame which are sold in regional markets. Because of the strong winds, land is being cultivated only during the spring/summer cycle, and even in irrigated land the crop outputs are below the national average. The land where the wind turbines are to be installed is being used for extensive cattle raising, although in the past it has been used for agricultural purposes (INEGI 2001). ",
